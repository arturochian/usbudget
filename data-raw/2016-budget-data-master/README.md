## Data for the The President's Fiscal Year 2016 Budget
Each year, after the President's State of the Union address, the Office of Management and Budget releases the Administration's Budget, offering proposals on key priorities and newly announced initiatives. This year we are releasing all of the data included in the President's Fiscal Year 2016 Budget in a machine-readable format here on GitHub. The Budget process should be a reflection of our values as a country, and we think it's important that members of the public have as many tools at their disposal as possible to see what is in the President's proposals. And, if they're motivated to create their own visualizations or products from the data, they should have that chance as well.

You can see the [full Budget on Medium](http://go.wh.gov/2016budget).

## About this Repository

This repository includes [three data files](data) that contain an extract of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) budget database.  These files can be used to reproduce many of the totals published in the Budget and examine unpublished details below the levels of aggregation published in the Budget.

The [user guide](USER_GUIDE.md) file contains detailed information about this data, its format, and its limitations. In addition, OMB provides [additional data tables, explanations and other supporting documents](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Supplemental) in XLS format on its website.
